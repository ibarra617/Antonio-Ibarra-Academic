### Background
I am a Junior studying Computer Science at Northern Illinois University. My passion for learning and making myself useful stems all the way from my childhood. I am passionate about expanding my knowledge on the latest technology and how it can be useful to our everyday lives. I am extremely passionate about making an impact in my community and pursuing opportunities that allow me to make a difference in today's society. Through my coursework here at NIU, I've established a strong foundation in Computer Science and am eager to apply my knowledge to the real world!
