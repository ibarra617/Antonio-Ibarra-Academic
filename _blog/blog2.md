# Blog Post 2 

What I learned about Markdown and Git and how they help me contribute to open source and improve professionally? I learned quite a bit from both Markdown and Git. I found it really helpful to find different ways to structure my text to make it easier to read and really give the reader the most they can out of my wrtiing. As for using git, I am happy to finally be learnig a valuable language that will be used in my career. I believe that git will be a useful skill that is definitiely necessary for me to know if I want to be a good programmer and collaborator. I am confident that these two languages will help me in succeeding in the workforce; As for opensource, I am not really sure as to how I will utilize these skills just yet, but I am sure they will pop up!

Have you used them before? I have not used markdown before explicitly, but I'm sure I have used built in tools that work with markdown to complete similar jobs. As for git, I have used it before for some group projects and it made it really easy to collaborate and work as a group more efficient and faster. I am glad to be using it a lot more with this seminar and to really advance my proficiency with this language.

What surprised you about Markdown or Git? What surprised me about these two languages was how simple they are. I feel like behind the scenes Markdown isn't crazy complicated but thats just my opinion, I feel like there are different ways to make your text have the same effect that markdown has without as much compication. However, I believe Git is extremely useful and simple. I can't believe how much control it has behind the scences over everything that happens on github.
