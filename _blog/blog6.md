# Blog Post 6

# My experience participating in MLH Global Hack Week: what I learned, what I contributed, and who I connected with.
## What I learned from participating in MLH Global Hack Week 
After participating in GHW, I was able to walk away with a few important and some not as important lessons and ideas.
I reinforced my ideas about contributing to GitHub repositories and how important some aspects about contributing to certain
repositories such as certain git commands, branching, forking, committing correct changes, etc. I was also able to learn about some 
object tracking tools using DEEPSORT. This experience was pretty cool, and although I got a bit lost and confused in some parts it was 
really helpful to be able to actively ask questions in the chat and just interact with people from all over the world participating in the 
same events as me 

## What contribution (or challenge) I made 
So for my challenge, I decided to register for AI/ML week. Although I don't currently know the meat and bones of what I am going to be 
participating for this week, I am very excited to find out the different kinds of activities I will be participating in using the tools of the future
I also signed up to receive all types of MLH merch to be able to represent this community more openly! 

## Who I connected with and learned from 
Although I did not make any formal connections, It was really beautiful to interact with the streamers and other viewers following along 
in the chat. I cannot give any names off the top of my head, but I'm sure if I really tried I could find the exact people I worked with 
when navigating through the events. Different kinds of people were sharing their thoughts, questions, and suggestions to what the speaker was 
presenting. I really enjoyed hearing all kinds of ideas bounce off the walls just from within a chat room. 

## How this experience shaped my view of open source collaboration 
This experienced really gave me a whole new perspective to how open source collaboration works and really affects everything. I used to not really see
it as a huge deal, but now I see why it is so widely advocated for. It is extremely important to push for people sharing all kinds of ideas and styles 
to different kinds of work. I always kind of had this sterotype about coders that they really kept to themselves and are more on the shy 
specturum, and although that may be true, it is extremely important to note how important sharing ideas and work is when trying to advance and make some ideas 
and work flow better. I cannot stress enough how much I enjoy this kind of collaborating within the world of open source, and I can't wait to be able to 
contribute more and share more of my ideas with the open source community!
