# Blog Post 3

## “How I chose a repository to explore and what I found interesting about its structure, community, and contribution process.”

I chose my repository through looking for what I thought was interesting and what really sparks my interest. I am absolutely in love with music so I googled open source projects that deal with music applications and surely enough I found ProjectM. I found it extremely interesting how collaborative and inclusive this project was. I thought it was really well structured and could see myself following a similar kind of design when working with projects on such a large scale such as this one. The community however was not as surprising. I know how supportive and great at collaborating the coding commmunity is and expected nothing less than respectful and meaningful contributions to a wonderful application. I can't wait to explore more open source projects and analyze their structure as well as the way many people find ways to collaborate with this.
