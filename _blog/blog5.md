# Ownership, Access, and Innovation: What I Learned About Licensing

## Reflect on something you learned about open source licenses (e.g., MIT vs GPL, what’s allowed, what’s restricted). 
Something I learned about open source licenses is that they are extremely important to the open source community they also have different guardrails as to how much freedom one has to contributing. Each license is different in how they shap collaboration and control in their respective software communities

## How did the Tetris movie shape your understanding of software ownership and distribution?
The Tetris movie highlighted how ownership over a specific type of software doesn't always revolve around only coding vbut also the legal aspects that happen behind the scenes and how important they are to claiming what is yours and such. It really shows how something as small as a game can have such an impact on the world and how who owns it can really thrive from that success

## What surprised or intrigued you about NIU’s approach to IP, patents, and tech transfer?
Unfortunately, I missed this part of semianr due to IBM TechXchange. However, through my own research I found that NIU actively supports innovation through tech transfer offices that really engage student and faculty to patent and monetize their ideas. It really puts into perspective how much universities and colleges want you to succeed by bridging the gap from academic ideas and creativity to real world applications.
Here is an example:

## How do you think licensing empowers or complicates open innovation?
I think licensing both empowers and complicates open innovation. It enables the collaboration aspect by openly defining fair use of what is and isnt yours but can restrict some creativity in the process.
