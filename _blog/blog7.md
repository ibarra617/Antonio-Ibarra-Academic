# Blog Post 7

# What counts as a contribution in open source? 
What counts as a contribution in open source can be any kind of collaboration that goes with the project. It could be anything from a non code contribution regarding documentation or 
translation to a code contribution changing the functionality of any files that make improvements or any different changes to the code. Here are some examples of some non code contributions and 
some low code contributions.

# My thoughts on the value of code and non-code contributions. 
My thoughts on the value of code and non code contributions are that they are quite important to developing and advancing open source projects. I think that any kind of contribution that gives 
any kind of help to making a project easier to read and use would be valuable. I think for something to be valuable it has to make a project simpler and just better regarding implementation, 
documentation, and translation. 

# How diagrams help clarify a workflows. 
A diagram can help clarify workflows by making them less confusing and make reduce the errors. I think that seeing the steps visually in a diagram would make it easier for contributors to see the
clear steps and avoid making mistakes. Additionally, I think it would be easy for people to get on the project faster and start contributing easier. 

# How communication and collaboration shape successful non code contributions. 
I think that communicationa and collaboration shape successful non code contributions because it makes it easier to get across what you want to say and help as with when collaborating on a project. 
if the communication and collaboration isn't there then it is very easy for people to mess up and make non code contributions confusing and messed up.

# What non code contribution opportunities did you find?
I found some non code contributions on a lot of public repositories. There are a lot of repositories that just have some documentation and translations on files and even though it doesn't directly 
affect the code and just make files a lot easier to read and understand. Some examples I saw were on freeCodeCamp. They have a lot of non code contributions on their files and if you go to any of 
those issues and files you'll see plenty!
