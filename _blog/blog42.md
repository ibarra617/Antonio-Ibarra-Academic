"Reveal.js: My First Deep Dive into an Open Source Project"
How its structured
Reveal.js is structured as a HTML presentation framework. It uses a single index.html file where the slides presented are written using the section elements. This specific framework has layers of javascript modules for certain aspects of the interaction features. Some of theese may include special navigation, slide transitions, speaker notes on PDF, etc. There is a lot you cam do with Reveal.js to make your presentation more engaging and interactive! The repository on github is really useful for explaining the different ways someone can utilize Reveal.js.

Documentation and How this project is maintained
In my opinion, I believe that Reveal.js is extremely well documented and maintained. There is a lot of activity happening on this project in github that makes it extremely easy to have trust in. Well written documentation and active maintenence is important to keeping a project like this really intact. The README is really descriptive ad has many examples and guides that make it easy for anyone to get started. There is a clear contribution guideline at the top of the issues page that makes it clear to anyone contributing what must be done when contributing. This whole repository shows a lot of community involvement, it's really nice to see. The accessability for users who just want to make their HTML program more interactive is really nice.

Could I see myself contributing to this?
I could not see myself contributing to this project, but only because this project requires a lot of knowledge around Javascript and HTML. My HTML knowledge is not the worse, but for contributing to a large scale project like this I definitely need to expand my knowledge. As for Javascript, I know absolutely 0 of this language so I do not feel comfortable working on something that requires so much of it. I 110% want to expand my knowledge om Javascript because I know it can be a powerful language especially for web development. Contributing to projects like this is another reason as to why developers like me should learn languages like Javascript!
